# Beginner C Programs

Welcome to the Beginner C Programs repository! This collection contains simple and foundational C programming exercises and examples designed to help learners grasp the basics of C programming, from introductory syntax to advanced concepts like pointers and structures.

## Table of Contents

| S. No. | Topics | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| 1. | [Introductory C Programs - Part 1](#introductory-c-programs---part-1) | Includes basic programs to introduce variables, input/output operations, and arithmetic calculations. These programs focus on foundational concepts such as digit sums, reversing numbers, simple time and distance conversions. |
| 2. | [Introductory C Programs - Part 2](#introductory-c-programs---part-2) | Continues with slightly more involved programs using loops, conditionals, and user input, helping develop problem-solving skills with numerical and logical operations. |
| 3. | [Ternary Operator](#ternary-operator) | Examples and exercises demonstrating the use of the conditional ternary operator for compact decision-making expressions in C. |
| 4. | [Conditional Statements - If-Else](#conditional-statements---if-else) | Programs focused on decision-making using if-else constructs to solve problems like checking even/odd numbers, comparing values, and validating input. |
| 5. | [Conditional Statements - Switch Case](#conditional-statements---switch-case) | Includes programs that use switch-case statements for multi-way branching and handling discrete values efficiently. |
| 6. | [Simple Numerical Problems](#simple-numerical-problems) | Basic numerical computations including sums, averages, digit manipulations, and straightforward algebraic operations. |
| 7. | [Complex Numerical Problems](#complex-numerical-problems) | More involved problems requiring multiple steps, such as solving quadratic equations, leap year checking, and factorial computations. |
| 8. | [Pattern Printing](#pattern-printing) | Programs to print common patterns (e.g., stars, numbers) using nested loops to understand loops and nested control structures. |
| 9. | [Iteration and Binary Conversion](#iteration-and-binary-conversion) | Examples using loops for counting, summing, and converting decimal numbers to binary representation. |
| 10. | [Basic Arrays](#basic-arrays) | Introduces arrays as collections to hold multiple values, with programs focused on array input, traversal, and simple processing. |
| 11. | [Matrices](#matrices) | Programs to work with two-dimensional arrays (matrices), covering initialization, element access, and matrix operations. |
| 12. | [Function Call without Return](#function-call-without-return) | Demonstrates void functions performing tasks and displaying results without returning values. |
| 13. | [Function Call With Return](#function-call-with-return) | Exercises using functions that return computed results, such as factorial or arithmetic calculations, with output handled in main. |
| 14. | [Recursion](#recursion) | Examples illustrating recursive function calls to solve problems like factorial computation and other classic recursive algorithms. |
| 15. | [String](#string) | Basic string operations such as reading, printing, and simple manipulations using character arrays. |
| 16. | [String Functions](#string-functions) | Programs utilizing standard C library string functions for tasks like concatenation, comparison, and length calculation. |
| 17. | [Call By Reference](#call-by-reference) | Examples showing function parameter passing by reference using pointers to modify variable values outside the function scope. |
| 18. | [Pointers](#pointers) | Introduction to pointers, pointer arithmetic, and their use with variables and arrays for dynamic and efficient data handling. |
| 19. | [Dynamic Memory Allocation](#dynamic-memory-allocation) | Programs illustrating memory management using malloc, calloc, realloc, and free for runtime memory control. |
| 20. | [Structure](#structure) | Examples using structures for grouping related data items and manipulating complex data types. |
